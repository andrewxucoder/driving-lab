# Driving Lab

Modular research workspace for multimodal driving intelligence projects. This repository organizes shared utilities, datasets, and project modules for representation learning, scene forecasting, cockpit assistance, and an integrated driving copilot.

## Structure

- `configs/` – Shared configuration presets for each module
- `data/` – Dataset pointers and cached assets
- `common/` – Logging, metrics, visualization, and utility helpers
- `modules/` – Four project tracks (multimodal representation, scene forecast, cockpit assistant, driving copilot)
- `scripts/` – Convenience entrypoint scripts
- `notebooks/` – Analysis and demo notebooks
- `docs/` – Documentation for roadmap and module guides

Refer to `docs/roadmap.md` for upcoming milestones.
